			<h3> Juche </h3>
			<p>Juche is the North Korean ideaology of self-reliance. This ideaology is 
				one of the main justifications for North Korean Censorship. Juche encourages 
				the indepednce of the masses of the people. To achieve true indepence it is believed 
				that citizens should be free of any outside influences.
			</p>

			<h3> State Control </h3>
			<p> Based on the ideaology of Juche the state maintians control of all forms of media accessed 
				in North Korea. Freedom of Speech is not available to North Korea's citizens. Citizens are also 
				unable to access foreign media without punishment. Punishment for acting outside of these limits can 
				range from being imprisoned in a political camp to death.

			<h3> Censorship and Propaganda as a citizen </h3>
			<h4> Childhood </h4>
			<p> The enforcment and instillment of propoganda and censorship begins when citizens are children. In schools 
				students are taught about the state's rulers through music and theater. 
			</p>
			<h4> Adulthood </h4> 
			<p> During adulthood citizens are strictly survielled. There are neighboorhood patrol personel that survey neighboorhoods
				for criminal activity. Citizens are not allowed access to cellphones, foreign television or radio stations, or news
				outlets.
			</p>
